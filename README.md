Abusing Reddit API to host the C2 traffic, since most of the blue-team members use Reddit, it might be a great way to make the traffic look legit.

## Requirements
Install **PRAW** library in python3:  
```bash
pip3 install praw
```

## Quickstart
See the [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/kleiton0x00/RedditC2/wiki/Setup) on how to get going right away!

## Demo

## Workflow
### Teamserver  
1. Go to the specific Reddit Post & post a new comment with the command ("in: <encrypted command>")
2. Read for new comment which includes the word "out:"
3. If no such comment is found, go back to step 2
4. Parse the comment, decrypt it and read it's output
5. Edit the existing comment to "executed", to avoid reexecuting it

### Client  
1. Go to the specific Reddit Post & read the latest comment which includes "in:"
2. If no new comment is detected, go back to step 1
3. Parse the command out of the comment, decrypt it and execute it locally
4. Encrypt the command's output and reply it to the respective comment ("out:" <encrypted output>)

Below is a demonstration of the XOR-encrypted C2 traffic for understanding purposes:

## Scanning results
Since it is a custom C2 Implant, it doesn't get detected by any AV as the bevahiour is completely legit.

## TO-DO
- [X] Teamserver and agent compatible in Windows/Linux  
- [X] Make the traffic encrypted  
- [X] Add upload/download feature
- [ ] Add persistence feature
- [ ] Generate the agents dynamically (from the TeamServer)
- [X] Tab autocompletion
